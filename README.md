# esp32-fake-virus-prank
This project turns your ESP32 into a fake "Hacked" WiFi access point, complete with a full-screen captive portal simulating a system infection, error popups, BSOD, fake permission requests, and terminal-style code animation. It's perfect for pranks harmless, visually convincing, and totally self-contained.
